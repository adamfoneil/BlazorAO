Most of my Blazor work is closed source, but I have a lot I want to share. This repo is still in its infancy, and will showcase all the techniques and approaches I use. In a nutshell:

- I use a Dapper-based data access approach using my [DapperCX](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Dapper.CX) project. I don't use EF or migrations. [Why?](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Dapper.CX/wiki)
- For general purpose querying, I use my [DapperQX](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Dapper.QX) project. [Why?](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Dapper.QX/wiki)
- I use [Radzen](https://blazor.radzen.com/) components.
